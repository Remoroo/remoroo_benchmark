# Run Report: run-1769277851
## ✅ Outcome: SUCCESS
**Reason**: The goal was to create a Python script that reads data.csv and calculates the mean of the 'value' column, printing the result as 'mean_value: X.XX'. The command executed successfully with an exit code of 0, and the output 'mean_value: 17.60' matches the expected format and calculation. The required metric 'mean_value' is present and correct, satisfying the experiment contract. No errors were detected, and the goal has been achieved.
