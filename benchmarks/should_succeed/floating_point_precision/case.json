  "goal": "Fix the variance calculation in stats.py. The naive formula suffers from catastrophic cancellation when values are large. For data [1e9+1, 1e9+2, 1e9+3], variance should be ~0.667 but the buggy code returns negative or wildly wrong values. Use Welford's algorithm or two-pass calculation.",
