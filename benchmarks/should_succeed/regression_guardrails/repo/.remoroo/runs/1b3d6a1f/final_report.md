# Run Report: run-1769301050
## ✅ Outcome: SUCCESS
**Reason**: The experiment successfully calculated the 35th Fibonacci number and printed the result as expected. The runtime metric (runtime_s = 2.5840126909315586e-06) is well below the threshold of 0.5 seconds, satisfying the required comparison for success. There were no errors or issues during execution, and the goal has been fully achieved.

## Goal
Implement the `fib(n)` function in `main.py` to calculate the 35th Fibonacci number. Print the result.

## Setup & Instrumentation
