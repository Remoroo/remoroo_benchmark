  "repo_path": "repo",
  "goal": "Fix and optimize the cache system to satisfy ALL constraints: (1) hit_rate >= 0.80, (2) peak_memory_mb <= 128, (3) avg_access_time_ms <= 5, (4) eviction_correct == true. Fix bugs in cache.py and optimize main.py. Run with 'python main.py' and ensure it writes artifacts/metrics.json with all four metrics.",
