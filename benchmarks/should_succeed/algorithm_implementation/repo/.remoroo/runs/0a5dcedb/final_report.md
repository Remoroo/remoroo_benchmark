# Run Report: run-1769280674
## ✅ Outcome: SUCCESS
**Reason**: The experiment has successfully achieved the original goal of completing the BinarySearchTree class in bst.py. The command executed without errors, and the output confirms that the in-order traversal is correct, matching the expected result. The required metric 'traversal_correct' is present and evaluates to true, satisfying the required comparison for success. No further iterations are needed as the goal has been fully met.

## Goal
Complete the BinarySearchTree class in bst.py.
