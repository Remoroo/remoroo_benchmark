  "description": "A small repo where metrics are noisy due to missing seeding. The engine must make it deterministic and meet an accuracy threshold.",
  "repo_path": "repo",
  "goal": "The repo simulates an evaluation metric with noise. Fix the implementation so it becomes deterministic (seeded) and achieves accuracy >= 0.90. It must write artifacts/metrics.json containing accuracy and deterministic.",
  "metrics": "accuracy >= 0.90, deterministic == true",
