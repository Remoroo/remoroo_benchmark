# Run Report: run-1769283299
## ✅ Outcome: SUCCESS
**Reason**: The experiment successfully executed the test command, and all tests passed without errors. The primary metric 'tests_passed' is satisfied as indicated by the test output showing 'OK' after running 3 tests. This aligns with the original goal of adding a multiply function and corresponding test, as the tests executed without failure. No further iterations are necessary as the goal has been achieved.

## Goal
Add a multiply function to calc.py and a corresponding test in test_calc.py.

## Setup & Instrumentation
