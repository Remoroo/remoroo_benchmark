  "goal": "Fix the has_cycle() function in graph.py. The current implementation incorrectly reports cycles in DAGs because it doesn't distinguish between nodes currently in the recursion stack vs nodes that were visited in a previous DFS path. Use three-color marking (white/gray/black) or separate 'in_stack' tracking.",
